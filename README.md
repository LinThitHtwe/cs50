    Just a simple baseball game where a batter (you) has to hit the ball to the catcher, which is moving across the screen.  
    You have to time it right and press the spacebar to hit the bat to send the ball to the catcher.  
    If the catcher catches it, a celebration sound will play, and the score will increase by one.
